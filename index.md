<p markdown="1"> Data Science Portfolio in construction...

I am an Data Scientist with experience in educational Natural Language Processing, looking for transitioning from Academics to Industry. I graduated in Physics at [University of Campinas](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/) in Brazil, worked with Education and became my Master in Philosophy of Science in Germany at [Leibniz University Hannover](https:). I have since there worked with Natural Language Processing in the educational context, first in the LernMint Project and recently as an assisten researcher in CATALPA. In this later proejct I worked with the development of an AI-based Automated Feedback System. I have also experience in teaching Data Science introductory disciplines at the [University of Applied Sciences of Hannover](https:). Foreseeing the transition, I have also during the last years maken efforts for learning and developing skills importants for Data Science Positions. You can find in this website my [resume](https:) which enumerates these skills and also a [portfolio](https:) demonstrate some of my habiblities. </p>
